Good evening, ranger.
Hello sir.
How's the water out there tonight?
Same as always sir.
Good. Tonight you're going after the Bessamer.

She was out on a resupply mission when we lost contact with her.

Investigate the ship and the research bases in the area.
Understood sir.
And be careful out there - we've got reportings of large creatures...
