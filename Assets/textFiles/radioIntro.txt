Good evening, ranger.
Hello sir.
How's the water out there tonight?
Same as always sir.
Good. Tonight you're going after the Bessamer.

She was out on a resupply mission when we lost contact with her.

Investigate the ship and the research bases in the area.
Understood sir.
Be careful out there - we've got reports of large creatures.
Never a boring day here sir.
Lastly, the techs here were having trouble with your electrical system.

They said that it should be fine but it might require a restart occasionally.
Very good sir.
Good luck ranger.
Thank you sir.
