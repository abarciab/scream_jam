Captain's Log 173:

Rotten luck that Swift Wind is out for repairs, but everyone should venture out to the site at least once, so I suppose it's our turn. This place always made me uneasy, between the strange creatures and the unpredictable weather - I like home much better. Seems like a storm is coming in now. Looks like this might be a bad one, but The Bessamer is prepared. We're not a large crew but worse comes to worse the ship can survive nearly any gale on her own. I should go make sure everyone's prepped for the winds.
