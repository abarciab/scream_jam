Captain's Log 176:

After we get back from this, I swear I'll find some way to get transferred. After a total of nearly a week in the storm it looked like it was clearing, but when we went abovedecks we were attacked by strange birds that injured 3 men. Two of them look alright, but the third - Markus - was hit pretty hard, and it's an ugly wound. We've got standard issue medicine but I don't think anything powerful enough to help him. At least we're finally here at the site. I'll radio down to the base and they'll send someone up for supplies. Oh maybe they're up early - sounds like there's some commotion on deck. Wait... something's shaking the ship!
