Captain's Log 173:

Our ship glides peacefully on the unfamiliar waters of this known, yet concealed world. As we approached what appeared to be an underwater abyss, an immense, serpentine creature of unfathomable proportions erupted from the depths. Its colossal form coiled around our vessel, crushing it with a deafening cacophony. Desperate SOS signals were dispatched, and our evacuation was initiated, but the vessel succumbed to the relentless force of the alien predator. As we abandon ship, we can see an underwater base on our scanners, beckoning us to take refuge within its secure confines, offering a glimmer of hope in the face of this sudden catastrophe.
