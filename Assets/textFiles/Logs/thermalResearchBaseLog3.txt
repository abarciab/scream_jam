Captain's Log 175:

The storm has kept up for two days continuously now, almost like we're being warned about going any further. Order are orders, but I don't like this one bit. Jean, our spotter, saw one of the massive creatures that live around here - she said it looked similar to a whale. They don't sit right with me most of the time but I would've liked to see that one. Maybe once this storm clears up I'll get another chance. Lord knows there's plenty of these things where we're going...
