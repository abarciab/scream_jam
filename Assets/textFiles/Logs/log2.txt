Underwater Research Base Log:

Our monitoring systems detected the distress signals from the surface research vessel as they encountered the colossal alien entity. We watched in shock as it crushed their vessel and claimed it as its own. Our mission now shifts from research to defense. The alien creature resurfaced, circling our base with an unsettling fascination, before launching a direct assault, testing the limits of our fortified structure. The base's hull is holding, but it's under immense pressure. We've initiated the evacuation protocols, transporting personnel to a secondary research base located far deeper underwater, hoping it will remain hidden from the creature's relentless pursuit.
